This is a React.js project to generate random quotes using api from https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable. You can generate a new quote by clicking the New Quote button, then the application will make a `GET` metod to API to get a new quote, update the state, and display it on screen.

## Tech Stack

- `React.js` - Javascript framework for building the UI
- `Tailwind CSS` - CSS framework for styling this simple project
- `Axios` - Make a call to an API

## What I Learn

This simple project teach me about API call using `axios` as third-party library and also some concept of React hooks such as `useEffect` and `useState`.
